# Ripple

> **The Continuous Design Loop** · v0.5.0

Ripple turns your live website into an active canvas for AI-assisted design. Instead of copy-pasting code snippets to your LLM, Ripple's UI Capture drops a direct tether to the element you want to change. It’s the fastest way to iterate on front-end design, backed by a session analytics engine that proves whether your changes actually worked.

## What It Does

1. **Omnipresent UI Capture**: `Shift+Right-Click` any element on your live site to instantly send its precise DOM context and your prompt to your AI assistant.
2. **Instant Iteration**: Your AI assistant edits the exact files, commits them, and your live site updates.
3. **Silent Validation**: In the background, Ripple tracks session data to compute before/after behavioral diffs of every deployment.
4. **Goal-Aware Insights**: Surfaces the impact in plain language: "Median session dropped 18% — here's why and what to try."

## The Core Loop

```
You see something to fix →
  Shift+Click to capture context →
    AI executes the exact change →
      Ripple logs the deployment →
        Tracks user behavior before/after →
          Proves if the UI change succeeded
```

## Modules

| Module | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tracker/` | Lightweight JS snippet that records sessions as JSON |
| `analytics/` | Session classification (bot/ghost/engaged), path analysis, view funnel |
| `git/` | Git log reader, deployment event detection, before/after windowing |
| `intelligence/` | Agent that generates goal-aware suggestions from diffs |
| `dashboard/` | Self-hosted web UI showing impact per commit |

## Testimonials

> "Workflow Momentum: The way we have the Ripple UI Capture set up feels incredibly synergistic. Getting precise element selectors and your immediate feedback right in the raw prompt files gives me a direct, unambiguous line of sight into exactly what needs to be done. It cuts out the guesswork and lets us move at lightspeed."

## Zero-Config View Tracking

Ripple's tracker is designed to automatically record navigation views to build your `view_funnel` without requiring custom tags. 
It does this by hooking into standard browser URL events:
- **`DOMContentLoaded`** (Initial page load)
- **`hashchange`** (Anchor navigation)
- **`popstate`** (Browser back/forward)
- **`history.pushState` / `replaceState`** (Monkey-patched for modern SPA frameworks)

**Important:** For auto-tracking to work seamlessly, your application *must* update the URL when navigating.

## Zero-Config Interaction Auto-Capture

Ripple v0.4+ automatically captures **every user interaction** across your application with zero manual tagging:

- **All clicks** — buttons, links, inputs, checkboxes, any element (using capture phase)
- **Input changes** — field values masked for privacy; captures type, label, and length only
- **Field focus/blur** — with time-in-field measurement
- **Scroll depth** — milestones at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- **Form submissions** — id, action, and method
- **Tab visibility** — tab_hidden / tab_returned with away-seconds
- **Widget state changes** — via MutationObserver watching `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, `data-active`, `open`, etc.
- **Rage-click detection** — 3+ clicks on same element within 600ms triggers `rage_click` event
- **Route changes** — auto-detects `pushState`, `replaceState`, `hashchange`, `popstate`

Use `data-ripple-event="my_name"` on any element to override the auto-detected event name.

## Indicator States

The floating Ripple indicator changes color to reflect the active mode:

| Color | State | When |
|---|---|---|
| ⚪ White | Idle | Reserved — tracker loaded, no mode active |
| 🔵 Blue | Prompt Mode | Default — tracker active, Shift+Right-Click to capture |
| 🔴 Red | Debug Mode | `?ripple_debug=1` or `localStorage.ripple_debug = true` |

Click the indicator to open the capture modal. The modal includes:
- A **Debug Mode toggle** link to enter/exit debug mode without editing the URL
- A **color legend** showing all three states
- A **View Dashboard** link to the session analytics dashboard

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Drop the tracker on your site
<script src="ripple.js" data-project="my-project"></script>

# 2. Point Ripple at your sessions folder and git repo
cp ripple.config.example.json ripple.config.json
# edit ripple.config.json

# 3. Run analysis
python scripts/analyze.py
```

## Multi-Project Setup

Each project gets its own scoped dashboard by convention. The tracker derives the dashboard URL from `data-ripple-path` if set, falling back to `/{PROJECT_KEY}` if not:

| Project | `data-ripple-key` | `data-ripple-path` | Dashboard URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Numen | `project-alpha` | *(not set — key matches folder)* | `/project-alpha/ripple/` |
| example.com | `example` | `/example.com` | `/example.com/ripple/` |

Use `data-ripple-path` whenever the project key doesn't match its folder name. The global cross-project dashboard lives at `/ripple/src/dashboard/`.

> **Note:** example.com injects the tracker dynamically via JS. `document.currentScript` is `null` in that context, so the tracker falls back to scanning `document.scripts[src*="ripple-tracker"]` to recover the `data-ripple-*` attributes.

## Status

🔵 **Stage: Develop** — actively building. First working version targets example.com as the proving ground.

See [PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md) for current stage and next actions.

## Philosophy

Built for indie developers and vibe-coders who:
- Ship via git push, not deployment pipelines
- Don't have a data team
- Want to know if their last change helped or hurt
- Can't afford enterprise analytics ($200+/mo)

Self-hosted. Your data stays local. No cloud dependency.
